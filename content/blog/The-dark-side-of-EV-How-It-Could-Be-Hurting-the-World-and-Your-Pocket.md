In today’s fast-paced world, where concerns about the environment and rising fuel costs are becoming more prevalent, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a popular choice for many consumers. With promises of zero emissions and long-term cost savings, EVs seem like the ideal solution for those who want to contribute to a cleaner and greener future while also saving money. However, recent research conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur suggests that the current state of EVs might not be as beneficial as we think. In fact, the study argues that hybrid vehicles, which combine an electric battery with an internal combustion engine (ICE) powered by fossil fuels, might actually be a better option for both the environment and our pockets.

## The Environmental Impact: Cradle-to-Grave Emissions

To determine the environmental impact of different types of vehicles, the researchers conducted simulations assuming a 10-year lifespan and an annual mileage of 20,000 kilometers. They calculated the emissions throughout the entire life cycle, from production to maintenance and recycling. The results were quite revealing.

According to the study, EVs emit approximately 187 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer of use (gCO eq./km), while hybrids emit around 167 gCO eq./km. In comparison, regular petrol cars emit 244 gCO eq./km. The analysis included the petrol and electric variants of the Tata Nexon and the hybrid version of Maruti Suzuki's Grand Vitara.

While it's true that EVs produce zero emissions from their tailpipes, the study highlights the significant emissions associated with the production of their massive batteries. The extraction, mining, and refining of materials like nickel, cobalt, and lithium for battery production contribute to substantial greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the overall environmental impact of EVs can be counterproductive, especially when considering their shorter lifespan compared to traditional petrol vehicles.

Furthermore, the electricity required to charge EVs in countries like India, which heavily rely on thermal power generated from burning coal, leads to increased CO2 emissions. This reliance on coal for electricity generation undermines the zero-emission claims of EVs and further highlights the environmental advantages of hybrid vehicles.

Hybrids, on the other hand, utilize smaller batteries that require fewer scarce metals. The reduced size of the battery leads to lower emissions associated with mining and processing. Moreover, hybrids can charge their batteries not only from an external power source but also through regenerative braking, where the battery gets charged whenever the car's brakes are applied. By combining the electric battery with the internal combustion engine, hybrids can also achieve better mileage and fuel efficiency.

Additionally, India has been increasingly blending ethanol derived from sugarcane into its fuel, which has proven effective in reducing emissions. This further strengthens the case for hybrids as a more environmentally friendly option in the Indian context.

## The Cost Consideration: Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

When it comes to the cost aspect of owning a vehicle, several factors need to be considered, including the initial purchase price, annual maintenance charges, and fuel or electricity costs. The researchers examined two scenarios to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EVs and hybrids.

In the first scenario, where EVs benefit from government subsidies and have no fuel costs, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) per kilometer for both EVs and petrol-powered vehicles is around ₹13. However, the TCO for hybrids is slightly higher at ₹14.

However, if the government were to provide similar incentives for hybrids after considering their positive impact on emissions, the hybrid vehicles would emerge as the clear winner. The TCO for hybrids would decrease to just ₹11 per kilometer, making them more cost-effective in the long run.

It's important to note that these calculations are based on the current context and market conditions in India. The cost-effectiveness of EVs and hybrids can vary in different regions, depending on factors such as government policies, electricity costs, and availability of charging infrastructure.

## Conclusion

While electric vehicles have gained significant popularity and are often hailed as the future of transportation, it's crucial to consider their actual environmental impact and cost-effectiveness. The research conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur suggests that hybrids, with their lower emissions and comparable costs, could be a better option in the current context.

However, it's important to acknowledge that technology is constantly evolving, and advancements in battery technology, renewable energy sources, and charging infrastructure could potentially make EVs a more viable and sustainable choice in the future. As we continue to work towards a greener future, it's essential to assess and reevaluate our choices to ensure we make the best decisions for both the environment and our wallets.
