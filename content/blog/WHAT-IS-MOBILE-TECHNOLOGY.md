## What Is Mobile Technology?

Mobile technology is a category consisting of a wide range of devices, with new two-way technology being created each day with unique uses. Regardless of form factor, all of these are linked by their capability to send and receive signals by communicating with other devices on networks.

 

### Types of Mobile Networks

For a mobile tech device to connect to other devices or use the internet, it must have access to a network that allows it to transmit a signal. Though mobile technology is often exemplified by physical devices, networks and their infrastructure can also be considered mobile technology. Each network is unique in its functionality.





* Cellular Networks: Cellular networks operate through radio networks distributed via cell towers, which allows mobile devices to automatically switch frequencies to their nearest geographical tower without interruption. Cellular networks have the capability to service mass amounts of users at a single time and are currently in their fifth generation of service.
   
* 4G: Referring to the fourth generation of cellular service, 4G operates on packet switching technology and organizes data into smaller groupings for fast transmission before reassembling at the destination.
   
* 5G: The fifth generation of network service has led to new infrastructure for widespread adoption and operates at higher frequencies in aggregated bands. This allows networks to access more bandwidth and increase transmission speed. [5G](https://builtin.com/mobile-technology/5g-companies) is reported to be [up to 100 times faster](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide-digital-identity-and-security/mobile/magazine/5g-vs-4g-whats-difference#:~:text=5G%20up%20to%20100%20times,for%20an%20increasingly%20connected%20society.) at sending and receiving signals than 4G.
   
* Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi utilizes radio wave technology to connect devices to localized hotspot routers. Internet providers allow users to connect to their network but will not automatically pass signals to a device without a WiFi connection. Users will often have the ability to make their WiFi network available for public or private use.
   
* Bluetooth: Rather than connect devices to the internet, Bluetooth networks connect devices to other devices via short-wavelength radio waves.

### Mobile Device Examples

Mobile devices are everywhere, and they’re not just limited to the phones in our pockets. Whether it’s distributing a stronger WiFi signal or enabling a user to access phone calls from their wrist, mobile devices come in all shapes, sizes and functionalities. Some of the most popular forms of mobile technology include: 

* Smartphones: [Most people in the U.S.](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/) have access to a smartphone today, but any cell phone can be considered mobile technology.
   
* Laptops: An evolution from the notebook computers of the past, modern laptops come in a variety of sizes but nearly all contain two-way network connectivity capabilities and can be used in a variety of environments.
   
* Tablets: Often operating on the same systems as smartphones but with more powerful components, tablets offer even more portability than laptops with much of the same functionality.
   
* Smartwatches: These devices are designed to sync with other devices, like smartphones or laptops, and utilize cloud capabilities to display notifications and applications on a smaller, wearable screen.
   
* Hotspots: Devices require an internet connection of some kind to access the internet and hotspots provide a solution when a connection would be otherwise unattainable. Often running via cellular networks, hotspots host private WiFi networks that users can connect to in a wider range of environments.
   
* Mobile Gaming Consoles: Gaming consoles have long existed in portable forms, but newer generations possess the power to rival home consoles and feature two-way connectivity for accessing downloadable content, playing games with others over a network and sending messages. 
   
* IoT Devices: Many, but not all, [IoT devices](https://builtin.com/internet-things/iot-devices) can be considered mobile technology, such as sensors and smartwatches. These devices represent a broad category and react to their environment to communicate specific signals when an event is triggered.
