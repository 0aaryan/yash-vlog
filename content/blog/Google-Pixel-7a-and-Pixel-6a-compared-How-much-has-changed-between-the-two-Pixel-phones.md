Design-wise, the Pixel 7a design is arguably the same as its predecessor Pixel 6a.

The [Pixel 7a](https://www.91mobiles.com/google-pixel-7a-price-in-india) is the latest mid-range smartphone from the software giant Google. The handset was launched at Google I/O 2023 and comes with numerous changes under the hood. Design-wise, the Pixel 7a ([review](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-7a-review/)) design is arguably the same as its predecessor Pixel 6a. The latter is still available for sale in India, and with its current asking price, it is a great option for budget-minded people. However, the [Pixel 6a](https://www.91mobiles.com/google-pixel-6a-price-in-india) doesn’t offer the same level of performance and features as the Pixel 7a. 

Here is a quick comparison of the Pixel 7a with Pixel 6a to find out how much has changed between the two Pixel smartphones.

* Pixel 7a: The handset has been priced in India at Rs 43,999 for the sole 8GB RAM and 128GB storage variant. The Pixel smartphone is available in sea, charcoal, and snow colour options.
* Pixel 6a: The handset was launched at Rs 43,999 last year, but it is currently selling in India for as low as Rs 28,999. The phone comes in two colour variants: charcoal and chalk.



Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7: Design and dimensions

![](</images (5).jpg>)

Except for the slightly additional weight of the Pixel 7a (193.5 grams) compared to the Pixel 6a (178 grams), the two phones are more or less the same. It is indeed because the Pixel 7a is the successor to the Pixel 6a, and Google has believed hard in the phrase, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. The Pixel 7a also has the same, flush dual camera setup at the back, and the plastic back has been retained, now with support for wireless charging. The dimensions are slightly different for the Pixel 7a at 152 x 72.9 x 9 mm, compared to the Pixel 6a’s 152.2 x 71.8 x 8.9 mm.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Display

The Pixel 7a has a 6.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels and a pixel density of 20:9 and a screen-to-body ratio of 81.8%. The display has a 90Hz refresh rate, too, similar to the one on the Pixel 6a. This results in smoother animations and scrolling, especially when you are using apps like the phone’s home screen, web browser, and social media apps. The Pixel 6a also has a 6.1-inch OLED display, but it has a 60Hz refresh rate. But it has a slightly better screen-to-body ratio of 83.0% with the same Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Processor

The Pixel 7a is powered by the latest Google Tensor G2 processor. The Tensor G2 is a second-generation custom-designed processor from Google and comes as a second-gen attempt by Google to power its devices with in-house chips. It is said to be 18% faster than the original Tensor processor found in the Pixel 6a. This means that the Pixel 7a can handle more demanding tasks, such as gaming and video editing, more smoothly. The Pixel 7a’s Tensor G2 is coupled with the Mali-G710 MP7 GPU, compared to the Mali-G78 GPU on the Pixel 6a’s Tensor. This one, too, expectedly offers slightly better gaming performance.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: RAM

The Pixel 7a has 8GB of RAM. This is significantly more RAM than the 6GB found in the Pixel 6a. More RAM means that the phone can handle more apps and tasks at the same time without slowing down. For example, you can have multiple apps open in the background without having to worry about them reloading when you switch back to them. And, while, 8GB standard RAM on a flagship Android smartphone in 2023 might not be the best, Google might have some custom optimisation up its sleeves.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Storage

The Pixel 7a comes with 128GB of storage space, which is the same as the Pixel 6a. There is no upgrade option available in both cases.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Rear cameras


The Pixel 7a has a dual rear camera system. The main camera is a 64MP sensor and an ultrawide camera has a 13MP sensor. The Pixel 6a has a dual rear camera system, too. But, the main camera is a 12.2MP sensor, and the ultrawide camera is a 12MP sensor. Just by sheer specifications, the Pixel 7a seems superior here. According to Google, the Pixel 7a can take sharper photos and videos, and it can handle low-light conditions better.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Front cameras

The Pixel 7a has a 13MP front-facing camera, while the Pixel 6a also has an 8MP front-facing camera. Both phones have good front-facing cameras for taking selfies and video calling.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Battery

![](</images (10).jpg>)

Interestingly, the Pixel 7a has a 4,385mAh battery, which is smaller than the Pixel 6a’s 4,410mAh battery. But with an improved Tensor G2 processor, you can expect it to last longer with better optimisation. The Pixel 7a maintains official support for 18W fast wired charging, much like that on the Pixel 6a. However, it brings 7.5W wireless fast charging to the mix as well. It isn’t the best, but welcome, nonetheless.

Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Software

The Pixel 7a runs a stock version of Android 13 out of the box, how Google meant for it to be. The Pixel 6a ran Android 12, the latest one from last year, but can now be updated to Android 13. Android 13 has a new design language, improved privacy features, and new productivity features, which offer a more enriching experience compared to last year’s Android 12.



## Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a: Price


The Pixel 7a starts at Rs 43,999 in India, for the sole 8GB RAM + 128GB storage, but HDFC Bank offers bring it below the Rs 40,000 price point. The Pixel 6a was launched in India last year at the same price but is now available online for a price of less than Rs 30,000. The Pixel 7a is substantially more expensive than the Pixel 6a but offers a number of significant upgrades, such as a faster processor, more RAM, a better camera system, wireless charging support, and more.

Key takeaways

The Pixel 7a is a significant upgrade over the Pixel 6a. It has a faster processor, more RAM, a better camera system, and wireless charging support. The handset also runs the latest version of Android. The only downside is that it is also more expensive, with a difference of more than Rs 10,000 at current prices. If you are looking for the best possible phone, then the Pixel 7a is the way to go. However, if you are on a budget, the Pixel 6a is still a great option.
