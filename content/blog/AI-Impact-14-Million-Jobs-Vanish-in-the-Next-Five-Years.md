title: 'AI Impact: 14 Million Jobs Vanish in the Next Five Years'
---

Massive disruptions are on the horizon for the global job market within the next five years as the economy experiences a downturn and businesses intensify their adoption of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence.

This revelation originates from a report released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which conducted surveys among over 800 companies to gather its findings.

In an annual gathering held in Davos, Switzerland, the WEF, known for bringing together leaders from across the globe, unveiled its discoveries. According to the report, employers anticipate the creation of around 69 million new job opportunities by 2027. However, they also anticipate the elimination of approximately 83 million positions, resulting in a net loss of 14 million jobs. This loss represents about 2% of the current global employment landscape.

Numerous factors will contribute to the volatility of the labor market during this period. The transition towards renewable energy systems will act as a potent catalyst for job creation, whereas sluggish economic growth and high inflation will fuel job losses.

Simultaneously, the rapid implementation of artificial intelligence will have both positive and negative repercussions. Companies will require a fresh influx of workers to aid in the implementation and management of AI tools. The demand for data analysts, data scientists, machine learning specialists, and cybersecurity experts is projected to grow by an average of 30% by 2027, as per the WEF.

However, this surge in AI utilization will also jeopardize several job roles as robots increasingly replace human workers in certain domains. The WEF predicts that by 2027, there could be a reduction of 26 million jobs related to record-keeping and administrative tasks. Occupations such as data entry clerks and executive secretaries are expected to bear the brunt of these losses.

Despite the recent hype surrounding advancements like ChatGPT, automation has seen relatively slow expansion in the early years of this decade. According to WEF's survey, organizations estimated that only 34% of all business-related tasks are currently performed by machines, a negligible increase from the figure recorded in 2020.

Furthermore, expectations for the pace of future automation adoption have been revised downward. In 2020, employers believed that 47% of tasks would be automated by 2025. However, their current projections indicate that this number will reach 42% by 2027.

In light of these transformations, companies are reassessing the skills and competencies required by their workforce. The ability to effectively utilize AI tools is now considered more valuable than computer programming, according to the WEF's report.

The evolving landscape of the global job market presents numerous challenges and opportunities, necessitating adaptability and upskilling to navigate the impending disruptions brought about by economic shifts and technological advancements.
