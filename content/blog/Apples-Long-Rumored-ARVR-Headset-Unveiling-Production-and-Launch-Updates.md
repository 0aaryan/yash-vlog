Apple's long-rumored AR/VR headset is one of the most highly anticipated tech products of recent years. According to investment firm Morgan Stanley, the headset will finally enter mass production in October and is expected to launch by December. The company is still set to unveil the headset at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) next week, where they will provide developers with tools to create apps for the device, which will have its own App Store. In this article, we'll delve into the latest updates surrounding Apple's AR/VR headset and explore the implications for consumers and the tech industry as a whole.

## Apple's AR/VR Headset: Production and Availability

### Mass Production Delay

While Apple enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting the announcement and release of the AR/VR headset, recent supply chain checks suggest that mass production won't commence until October '23. This means that the general availability of the device is most likely to happen ahead of the December holidays. The delay in mass production indicates that Apple wants to ensure a polished and high-quality product before it reaches the hands of consumers.

### Limited Supply and Pricing

Apple's supply chain is reportedly preparing to assemble only 300,000 to 500,000 headsets in 2023, indicating limited availability during the initial period. Additionally, it is widely rumored that the headset will come with a starting price of around $3,000. While this places it in the higher price range, Apple's reputation for premium quality and cutting-edge technology may still attract a significant number of early adopters.

### Profit Margins and Business Strategy

Erik Woodring, an Apple analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects the company's gross margins for the AR/VR headset to be "close to breakeven at first." This suggests that Apple is prioritizing market penetration and establishing a user base over maximizing immediate profits. By offering a highly immersive AR/VR experience, Apple aims to solidify its position as a leader in the tech industry and lay the groundwork for future innovations.

## Unveiling at WWDC: What to Expect

### AR/VR Headset Announcement

Apple's AR/VR headset is expected to take center stage at the upcoming WWDC event. While rumors and leaks have provided some insights into the device's features and capabilities, the official announcement will provide a comprehensive overview of what users can expect. The unveiling will likely showcase the sleek design, advanced display technology, and revolutionary user interface that Apple is known for.

### Developer Tools and App Store Integration

One of the most crucial aspects of the AR/VR headset's success will be the availability of a robust ecosystem of apps. Apple understands this and plans to provide developers with the necessary tools to create immersive experiences for the headset. The introduction of an App Store specifically tailored to the AR/VR headset will enable users to explore a wide range of applications and experiences, from gaming to productivity and beyond.
